Actually im moving the wiki to the this README.md

Please see the wiki until it's finished - https://github.com/DaRaFF/jsgamewiki/wiki.  :-)

#Welcome to the jsGameWiki!

This is the brain for game programming with html5/canvas/javascript. 

I'm trying to structure helpful sources like eBooks, videos, blogs, articles, presentations...


### Structure

Part I - Here is the stuff which is really relevant to game programming with html5/canvas/javascript

Part II - Here is the stuff which is related to webdevelopment and can be useful if you want to improve your basic skills


### Other Sources

First good start point for good javascript resources is bebraw with his sensational [jswiki](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki). 

Actually I see jsGameWiki as an addition to jsWiki for game programming topics.


### Contributors

In case you want to contribute, let's do it! Here is a place for people who whants to learn something about game programming and I'm very happy if you have some interesting sources.
This wiki is open for anyone to modify. If you change something, please do explain what and perhaps why.


### Let's start

True to the maxim - release early, release often - my first commit is only a starting point. Content and structure can and should change over time.

And now, have fun :-)
